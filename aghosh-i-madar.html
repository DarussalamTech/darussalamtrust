          	<h2>What is the Aghosh-i-Madar<br><span>(Lap of the Mother)?</span></h2>
            <h4>Darussalam Research Center is also a unique<br> project of Darussalam International. </h4>
            <div class="scrolling_text" style="height:600px;">
            <p style="margin-top:0px;">Some sincere fellows have decided to establish and run such an institute, named Agosh-i-Madar, only for the pleasure of Allah, in which those children will be brought up and educated, who are deprived of affection and kindness of the father and lap and motherhood of the mother, and they will be provided all the contingent facilities of life including lodging. The greatest object of establishment of this institute is to seek Divine Pleasure and Paradise. Insha Allah!</p>
<p>There is no doubt that in Pakistan there are tens of institutes where arrangements of religious and worldly education of children have been made, but their efforts are far behind the requirements. The requirements are even increasing day by day due to inflation. People’s economy is gradually shrinking day by day. Each one is for himself. People are worried by compulsion of circumstances, so much so that it becomes hard to rely upon white-collar livelihood.</p>
<p>In these circumstances it becomes compulsory for comparatively prosperous and wealthy people to take responsibility of supporting orphan and poor children and to seek pleasure of their Lord by becoming a support for this poor class living in critical conditions.</p>
		<h2>Planning for Aghosh-e-Madar</h2>
            <p>For Aghosh-e-Madar Project a land of 2.25 acres (approximately 7435 square meters) adjacent to Kot Abdul Malik Motorway Interchange at Lahore-Sheikhupura road has been purchased. It lies at a distance of 15 km from Civil Secretariat and the District Court, of Lahore. Its total price is 32.5 million rupees.</p>
			<p>By the grace of Allah the token money has been paid. Remaining amount is to be paid within 4-6 months. The 5 acre land of Darussalam Quran Printing Complex is also adjacent to it. The school under Aghosh-e-Madar program will be designed in such a way that the building of the school and the hostel be completely separated.</p>
			<p>A 2 acre plot has been bought, 1 acre for school building and 1 acre for hostel building. In 4-stories building of the school, there will be a capacity of more than 1000 boys and 500 of them, orphans and poor children, will stay with us in the hostel. The remaining 500 students from the area will get education as day scholars who will pay their fees regularly and this income will be spent on orphans and poor children under sponsorship.</p>
            <h2>Significant Features of Aghosh-e-Madar Program</h2>
            <ul>
            	<li>In Aghosh-e-Madar, from the very beginning, the faith of Tawheed will be embedded in the minds of under training children. Full efforts will be made to make them fravourite Muslims of Allah according to the instructions of the Quran and the Hadith. </li>
                <li>In Agosh-e-Madar, the children will be trained creating love for the Prophet of Allah and his Companions, according to the ways told by the Prophet (P.B.U.H) and guiding principles of the Companions. </li>
                <li>In Agosh-e-Madar, the children will be made true, pure and practical Muslims and at the same time patriotic Pakistanis. In them sentiments of patriotism will be raised and created in scientific manner. </li>
                <li>In agosh-e-Madar, children, cognizance of self and self-respect will be matured.</li>
                <li>Full efforts will be made to make these children regular offerers of the prayers, accustomed to recitation of the Holy Quran, in habit of Zikr-o-Azkar and abiding by religious and moral teachings.</li>
                <li>As a result of this noble education, the children of Agosh-e-Madar will become a lasting charity for their real parents and spiritual parents (who sponsor them), Insha Allah.</li>
                <li>The students will also be adorned with education of some trade and art along with proper education and training, so that they become best asset of society, instead of being a burden on it. </li>
                <li>We will try our best, with good wishes, that the child is provided an environment, consistent to his home and mother’s affection, to the possible extent, where he will be trained, with extreme love, in the light of Noble Islamic Values.</li>
                <li>The character-building of the children of Agosh-e-Madar will be made in such a way that they do not extend pans before others, maintaining their self-respect. </li>
                <li>The children of Agosh-e-Madar will be glutted with the passions of sacrifice and selflessness, so that they may take pride in giving their share to others. </li>
                <li>Allah Willing, we will adorn the children with such modern and high education that, in future, they establish their own identity as pride-worthy Muslims, doctors, engineers, economists and trust-worthy traders.</li>
                <li>In Agosh-e-Madar passions of kindness will be raised so that, in future, they also extend their hands of compassion to the orphans and needy children. </li>
               </ul>
               <p>For this purpose a teacher will be appointed at least for 20-25 children. Likewise, there will be a mushrif (warden) for the children in the same number. The children will get education in a part of the day and be under training in their hostel rooms in the remaining part. Separate staff will be appointed to look after them. This staff will be called Mushrifeen. </p>
               <p>At the first stage, school system will work upto middle level. After that, with the Grace of Allah, at the second stage educational planning will be made from Matric upto F.Sc, so that the students are prepared for admission in some standard universities, on merit. </p>
               <h2>Rules and Regulations of Agosh-e-Madar</h2>
               <ul>
               		<li>The children will be awakened for Fajr prayer like an ideal Muslim family. They will be given due time for the preparation of Wudu (ablution).<br> The Mushrrif will check that every child must clean his teeth with Miswak or brush. </li>
                    <li>The children will be made  learn the Masnoon Azkar by heart.</li>
                    <li>There will be a monitor in each room who will be chosen from the children on the basis of his performance. He will manage that his room-mates learn Masnoos Azkar by heart and recite them daily and regularly. </li>
                    <li>The monitors will be changed intermittently, so that every child gets an opportunity to raise his potentials and create leadership abilities in himself.</li>
                    <li>There will be a Mushrif (warden) to keep watch on five rooms. He will examine the rooms of the children before they go to bed, in order to have satisfaction that the bed of the child, sheets and blanket are neat and clean. </li>
                    <li>Every child will have a cupboard in which his clothes, shoes, socks and other things will be placed in order.</li>
                    <li>After the Fajr prayer, the children will have a lesson of 15 minutes in the very mosque, in which they will be informed of tasks to be done that day in addition to pieces of advice and admonition. </li>
                    <li>The atmosphere of Agosh-e-Madar will not be like a prison where every time and everything is watched critically or harshly, but there will be homely atmosphere of love and affection.</li>
                    <li>Practically every effort will be made to provide full opportunities to those children who have inborn capabilities to make progress. They should not lag behind only for the reason that they were orphans and there was none to guide them.</li>
                  <li>The chief warden of the hostel will be above 40 and highly educated. Hostel staff will reside in the premises of Aghosh-e-Madar, but their rooms will be separate from those of the children. Their duty time will start after school time and they will do their duty of training and supervision till the children go to their beds.</li>
                    <li>The hostel staff will supervise breakfast, lunch, dinner and other activities of the children.</li>
                    <li>Nice and standard food will be served in the breakfast, lunch and dinner, and changes will be brought in it according to the climate.</li>                   
              </ul>
              <h2>Extra Curricular Activities</h2>
               <ul>
               		<li>We have vast space where children can play and enjoy. Here they will be provided a ground for football, hockey and cricket. A beautiful floral park will be made where the children will have a walk and be able to improve their physical health. </li>
                    <li>The children will also be provided opportunities to play with teams of other schools at city, district, provincial and national levels so that they will be able to increase their self-confidence and ability of advancement. The children who show significant performance, will be awarded precious prizes.</li>
                    <li>There will be strict watch on the children to prevent moral evils. The rooms will be fitted with security cameras to eradicate immoral activities. The chief warden will control them.</li>
                    <li>Every morning, the children will be given some pocket-money so that they may have feeling of being at home.</li>
                    <li>A canteen and a super market will be established where children will be able to buy eatables and other things at their will.</li>
                    <li>There will be a workshop where the children will be taught ordinary skills, e.g. repair work, electrical skill of primary stage, etc.</li>
                    <li>The children will be made accustomed to do their work themselves e.g. they themselves wash and iron their clothes. All the children will clean their rooms collectively. They will do gardening on the holyday and clean their ground. Thus, they will have a feeling of responsibility.</li>
                    <li>After every six months the children will be taken to worth seeing places.</li>
                    <li>Competitions of Husn-e-Qirat, speeches and anlogium will be held and children will be regularly trained for them. </li>
               </ul>
              <h2>Religious and Moral Training</h2>
               <ul>
               		<li>The chief warden will hold the responsibility to tell the children faith-increasing incidents from the seerah or those of the Companions or great personalities of Islamic history, before they go to bed. This can also be done in the mosque after the Isha prayer.</li>
                    <li>The children will be instructed to call for the prayer and to lead the prayer turn by turn. Every child will be made learn Nazirah-Quran and Hifz (at least 3 parts) according to his capability.</li>
                    <li>A standard library will be set up to create in the children an urge for studies. In the library books and periodicals will be provided according to their mental level.</li>
               </ul>
              <h2>Order of the Project</h2>
               		<ul>
                    	<li>In the beginning, 60 rooms will be made for the hostel of the children and there will be at least 2.5 m wide verandas with them. Every room will be 8x6 m. A big hall will also be constructed. The rooms will have attached kitchen and mess system. The hostel building will also have a grain and rashion store, office of the chief warden, residential rooms for wardens, a room for other residing staff, wash room area, study hall, mosque, store for stationery and clothes, dispensary, laundry shop, barber shop, canteen and generator room. The building map will be designed by a competent architect and the building will be fitted with most modern facilities.</li>
                        <li>In the centre, there will be a beautiful fountain and a lawn in which swings will be arranged for the children.</li>
                        <li>A personal computer file of every orphan will be maintained in which his complete history will be written. There will be every kind of information about him, especially his family occupation, what was his father. Ast present monthly expenditure per child reaches 8,500-10,000 rupees.  The person or the organization that sponsors a child, the photo of the child will be sent to him. The profile of the child will be written on a form. The sponsor will be intimated about the education, health and other conditions of the child via email, after every three months. A talk will also be arranged between the child and the sponsor once or twice a year. </li>
                        <li>The sponsor will be expected to come to Lahore and see his ‘child’ in order to become directly aware of his educational progress.</li>
                        <li>The children of at least five years or more will be accepted in Aghosh-e-Madar. In vicinity of the main gate, 10 homes will be built for the children of 5-8 years. Every home will have an area of at least five Marlas. For them, such widows or divorced women will be hired who have no children of their own. The orphans will be handed over to those “mothers” so that they may teach and bring them up like real mothers.</li>
                        <li>For the children of 9-13 years of age, separate residence of one or two homes will be arranged. </li>
                        <li>If a child falls ill, his care will be responsibility of an aged widow or divorced woman, who will attend him like his real mother or sisters.</li>
                        <li>The design of the school building will be different from the residential building. The U or H shaped school building will comprise four floors. Every classroom will be spacious enough that at least 25-30 students may sit at their desks.</li>
                        <li>Rooms for principle, wise principle, head clerk, accountant, library, libratory and meeting rooms, staff rooms, computer lab, auditorium, book shop, canteen and stores will be constructed.</li>
                        <li>For providing ideal atmosphere  to 500 children, we will require non-teaching staff as under:</li>
